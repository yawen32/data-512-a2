# data-512-a2: Bias in data

## Goal
The goal of this project is to explore the concept of bias by analyzing the data of policical articles from different countries on Wikepidia. The project is supposed to perform an analysis from two aspects: existence and quality of policial articles for each country. The project should be fully reproducible by others by reading all resources listed in README file and following the step by step instructions in `hcds-a2-bias.ipynb`.

## Data
**There are two datasets need to be used in this project, read through all documentations and introductions carefully before you can download and use them**
1. Wekipedia article dataset

Documentation: `https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449`

Download:`https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9614893`

Unzip the file downloaded from the above link, the required dataset locates in \country\data named page_data.csv.

2. Population dataset

### Data file description
**After removing the rows that do not have matching data, there are five fields in the final data file (final_data.csv):**
* country: country names
  * Field Type: String
* article_name: 
  * Field Type: String
* revision_idï¼š
  * Field Type: Integer
* article_quality:
  * Field Type: String
* population:
  * Field Type: String

## API documentation
A Wikimedia API endpoint for a machine learning system called ORES needs to be used in order to get article quality predictions.
Documentaions and more information of ORES can be found here: `https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES`
Check Jupyter Notebook file `hcds-a2-bias.ipynb` to see how to use this API.

## Special considerations of data
In the process of collecting the data from Pageview API, we only focus on organic (user) traffic. Thus, traffic data by web crawlers or spiders was excluded by filtering agent type to user, while data from the Pagecounts API does not filter on agent.

Please check the notebook.
